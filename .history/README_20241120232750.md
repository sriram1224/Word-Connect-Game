# Word Connect Game

A fun word puzzle game built with React, designed to challenge your memory and improve your cognitive skills. Match groups of connected words and aim to get the highest score possible!

## Features

1. **Game Setup**:

   - The game board is dynamically generated based on configurable settings.
   - You can customize the number of word groups, the size of each group, and the number of columns displayed on the board using **Leva** controls.

2. **Game Logic**:

   - The player selects words in groups, and if the words are part of a valid group, they are marked as matched.
   - If the selection is incorrect, the words are reset after a brief delay.

3. **Scoring**:

   - For each correct match, the player earns 10 points.
   - The score is tracked during the game and compared against the highest score, which is stored in `localStorage`.

4. **Reset Game**:

   - A reset button allows you to start a new game, clearing the score and attempts.

5. **Responsive Design**:

   - The game is fully responsive, adjusting the layout to different screen sizes and maintaining usability on mobile and desktop devices.

6. **Sharing**:

   - After achieving a high score, the player can share their score on social media platforms like **Twitter**, **Facebook**, and **WhatsApp**, or simply copy a shareable link to send to others.

7. **Toast Notifications**:
   - A success notification is shown when a new high score is achieved.
